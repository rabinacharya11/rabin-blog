Do you even realize how someone can change your life?

Have you experienced such a change in your life?

Do you remember your first love? first heartbreak? Or, even the first feeling of butterflies in the tummy?  \
\
In this journal of mine, on this special day, I wanted to dedicate this article to one of the best people I have ever met, I call her **Sanu**❤️ with love.

## How did it start?

Around 4 years back, around this time of the year, I don't remember the actual date we got together, but I remember how it started!\
\
I had finished my SEE exam and was in Kathmandu for +2 education. It was around the start of Feb or maybe the end of Jan. One fine day, a girl who was a junior in my school replied to a random story I shared.

That phase of my life was kinda hard for me. I had left my hometown and came to the city of the unknown where every person I saw was just a stranger to me.\
\
Even asking for the direction was tough for me. Being an introvert I hated the interaction with the people. That introverted nature of myself made life even more difficult for me. \
\
I was going through a first and dead serious heartbreak during that phase of life. Add homesickness and taking the wrong stream in +2. All these things put me in a bad place and almost (or I was ) depressed. \
\
Well, ladies and gentlemen, she enters my life!\
\
She became the only reason for my happiness. Her strict family was the reason for us, being able to talk once a week or even once a month. Unlike love these days, we had the story of the 90's.  \
\
I always appreciated her efforts. Whenever she got the chance to use her parent's mobile. She used to run to a "**Makai Bari**" near her home and video call me with a lot of caution. She used to talk slowly almost whispering. Imagine the pressure of family and society members who could put her in big trouble. \
\
These would rarely happen, once a month (at most). Although this was not a frequent conversation considering the fact we were in long distance. She was in my hometown and I was in the valley. \
\
That one call, that single photo she sent was enough for me to wait for another conversation. I didn't mind that at all, she was just 14 at that time. \
\
Hey Sanu, I never thought you were serious. Instead, I thought it was puberty that was clicking in.

At that point, I was not aware if I was in love. But sure thing, you were the reason for my happiness.

## First time I saw her...

It was a sunny day of the month of Bhaishak, I was in my hometown. I was going to Itahari, but I was stressed out with something ( I didn't remember what it was ). \
\
By god grace, I saw her. She was with her father ( couldn't talk ). Our eyes met and that was enough to melt my stress. Just looking at her made me happy and that day I realized I was in love.

## Rough and Tough...

You found me in the rough situation of my life and you decided to provide me with love and care. \
\
In a month, 4 years of togetherness will be completed. I am in one of the tough situations again. You still motivate and help me to not overthink. Back then, I was more mature than you. Now, you handle my rough and tough times with maturity. \
\
I can't find words how important you are to me and I hope you know my mom loves you more than I do. \
\
Thank you love! \
Happy Valentine's Day, Sanu❤️

This long distance seems to have no end... it's hard but worth it!

Missing you has been a part of my routine!
