I am getting goosebumps when I ask this question to myself.

\
I have failed in many ways, almost a failure in everything.  I failed as an employer, I put down the hopes companies had for me.  I failed in startup because I didn't even validate my idea before jumping right into it.

\
Having made tons of mistakes and a lot of things that went wrong. Now, I didn't have any confidence to face the world and friends who are doing well in their lives and jobs.

\
I wasted myself in a lot of nonsense which didn't help me at all. I am energetic, many people have used my energy to do something for them and when I needed help none was there.

My family didn't support my passion and doubted me on everything. That may be the reason I started doubting myself and kept doubting my abilities to the point I couldn't even take action.\
\
I never felt this low in my whole career! I am broke to the point I have to depend on my family for everything. Last year around June I was making 50K NPR per month. Now, suddenly, going to zero is hard and depressing.

Luckily, my family started supporting me. I have a beautful girl by my side. I have a powerful machine that I can leverage to make things big. \
\
I have a goal for 2024, 2023 gave a lot of nerve and lessons to me. Now, in 2024 I will make use of those experiences and lessons to make $10K a month from different sources. \
\
I have self doubts and i don't  know if its even possible. But i know the snow ball effect. I am feeling hard to start but once i start with it. \
\
There will be no stopping!\
\
Yes, I will make it happen! \
\
I have the power to make $10k a month by 1st Dec, 2024. Remember the date!!
