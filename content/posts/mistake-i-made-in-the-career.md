I believe everyone makes mistakes at some point in different aspects of life. I have made many mistakes in life. In this journal, I will try to list the mistakes that I made especially in my career.

## Mistakes I made in my career

I started my career very early in the context of Nepal. I was 17 when I earned my first dollar. I can't even explain the emotion of getting money from the internet, living in the corner of a room in third-world countries like Nepal.

I got my first dollar from Fiverr. I made a few mistakes there as well. My first client was a college student who wanted me to teach him flutter. He wanted to learn to flutter for college assignments and later he asked me to do the assignment for him for which he paid.  That project got me 25 dollars and the second client was from Germany, a man in his mid-30s, he also wanted to learn to flutter from me.

Combing the money from both the projects I got it in the bank account. I was not that much but it was special.

I was learning flutter and at the same time making some money from side gigs.

After three months, I got my first major project. It was a full-stack restaurant project that  I had to make for a client in South Africa.   It was a around 200 dollars project, It took a month time to develop the backend in laravel, a mobile app using Flutter, and the web frontend in JS.

After the project was delivered, the client didn't want to pay the money. I was working without taking any advance from the client which was a bad decision.

## A lesson of the day

If you are into freelancing or even project-based work always ask for an advance before starting with the project. This will safeguard your efforts and you will feel motivated to get the project done.

Set milestones and after each complete milestone, ask the client to pay the money. This way you will not be scammed like me!
